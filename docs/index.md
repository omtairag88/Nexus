# Quality Assurance Guidelines

Welcome to the Quality Assurance Guidelines site for QA in SAP and BTP development at Equinor! Here you will find comprehensive resources to support your testing efforts, divided into two key areas: manual testing with qTest and automation with Tricentis Tosca. Our guidelines are designed to ensure high-quality software delivery by providing you with a structured approach and best practices for testing.

To get started, we have outlined step-by-step instructions in the "Getting Started" section for both manual testing with qTest and automation with Tricentis Tosca. These guides will help you set up your testing environment, understand the tools, and establish the necessary connections.

In the manual testing section, we focus on utilizing qTest, a powerful testing management platform.

Our [guidelines](./manual/guidelines.md) will walk you through various aspects, such as test case creation, execution, and reporting. Additionally, we have integrated the requirements in qTest with Equinor's existing Business Process Hierarchy (BPH) system, which is currently managed in Jira. This integration ensures traceability and alignment between the testing efforts and the defined business processes.

For automation enthusiasts, we offer comprehensive guidelines and best practices for Tricentis Tosca.

Automation plays a crucial role in streamlining testing processes, increasing efficiency, and reducing time-to-market. Our [guidelines](./automation/guidelines.md) will help you create robust automation scripts, execute them effectively, and analyze the results. You'll also learn how to maintain and update your automation assets to keep pace with the evolving software landscape.

Throughout the site, we have compiled best practices from our experienced test team at Equinor. These practices cover a wide range of topics, including test design, test data management, test environment setup, and test execution strategies. By following these guidelines, you can ensure consistent and reliable testing outcomes across projects. You find best practices for **[automated](./automation/tosca-best-practices.md)** and **[manual](./manual/qtest-best-practices.md)** testing.

We have also added an **[overview of the testing strategy](./projects/nextgen.md)** to allow you understand the different testing stages, what should the focus be, some entry and exit criteria and so on.

We understand that questions may arise during your testing journey, and our test team is here to support you. If you have any queries or need further clarification on any aspect of the guidelines, feel free to reach out to our team. We value your feedback and are committed to continuously improving our QA practices.

We hope this Quality Assurance Guidelines site serves as a valuable resource for your SAP and BTP development testing needs. Let's work together to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet Equinor's standards and exceed user expectations. 

**Happy testing!**
