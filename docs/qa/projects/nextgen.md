## Test Phases

|   |Unit Testing (UT)|Functional Testing (FT)|System Integration Testing (SIT)|User Acceptance Testing (UAT)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Testing Phase**  | Development  | Development  | Release  | Release  |
| **System**  | D09 (Client 390)  | Q09 (client 590)  | Q09 (client 490)  | T09 (client 590)  |
| **Test Methods**  | Automated code testing (TDD with ABAP Unit) <br>code review  | Automated regression testing;<br>Exploratory testing <br>Functional Testing  | Non-functional Testing (performance, usability, reliability, authorization, et)<br>Functional Testing  | Non-functional Testing (performance, usability, reliability, authorization, et)<br>Functional Testing  |
